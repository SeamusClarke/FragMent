# A code to study the fragmentation of filaments (FragMent)

FragMent is a python/C module which collates a number techniques used to study fragmentation in filaments. It also performs model selection using a frequentist and Bayesian approach to find the best descriptor of a filament's fragmentation. The code is open-source and can be downloaded here.

```
to the .bashrc file in the home directory.

To compile the C portion of the module use the command
